# Skyslope-Ripper

This tool is designed to automatically download archives from Skyslope paperless. The program is an IE wrapper.  Sign in with an account with archive access, browse the archive, and it should go mimic mouse actions to request downloads, and proceded through multiple pages.

This was a one time project, and will not be updated past basic cleanups on import. It's not polished, it got the job done when I needed it to, and I no longer have access to Skyslope to check anything.  If Skyslope updates their website code, this tool will no longer function. At the time of creation in December 2019, Skyslope had no bulk export option.
